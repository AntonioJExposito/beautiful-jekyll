I am a Lecturer at the 
      <a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/departments/department-of-chemical-engineering/" target="_blank">Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Bath</a>.
 My research interests focus on two main areas: catalyst design and reactor engineering. In particular, the development of microreactors and new hybrid photo-electrocatalysts that can be applied in environmental processes such as artificial photosynthesis.
